== SLPA == 
The source code is in the folder SLPA. The executable jar is added as well. This needs 4 command line arguments to be passed to execute, viz, the input file (full path), the number of iterations, the threshold (in range 0 and 1) and the output file to write the detected communities to.
eg. java -jar slpa.jar /home/rg_kavodkar/Documents/GDM/Project_2/metrics_code/amazon.graph.original 20 0.5 output_0_3_original.out 

===========
I've added few metrics output as well for differing thresholds.
